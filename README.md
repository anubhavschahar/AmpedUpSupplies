# AmpedUpSupplies
AmpedUp Supplies is a project that I did in my internship of Solveforge Private Limited as a web developer. In this the web page was made for the company AmpedUp  which deals with the battries and inverter. This was the project done in team of three member. We all made this website attractive and functionable. Every member made equal effort.
